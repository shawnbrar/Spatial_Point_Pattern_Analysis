# Understandin Fire Emergencies: Spatio-Temporal Point Pattern Analysis

Understanding Fire Emergencies by the way of spatial point analysis was quite informative. We saw that there was inhomogeneity in the data, i.e. their intensity is more in some regions than others. We also saw that the intensity of the fire emergencies also depends on the amount of workload. Also, there was definite clustering in the data. The data also follows an imhomogenous process, one of which was explored.
